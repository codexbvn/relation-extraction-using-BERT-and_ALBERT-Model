# Relation-extraction-using-BERT-and-ALBERT-Model
This project aims to explore the use of BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) and ALBERT (A Lite BERT) models in performing relation extraction on the ATIS (Airline Travel Information Systems) dataset, a powerful pre-trained transformer models, for relation extraction from text.
